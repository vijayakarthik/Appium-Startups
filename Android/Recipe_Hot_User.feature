Feature: H-E-B Cart page Recipe module feature

General comments : 
1) Include "page validation" keyword in the scenario for easy identification of the page elements validation
2) For Hot user , instead of mentioning as register a new user mention the validation to be covered as " login as an User"

Over all it looks clear and understandable .... :) 

Few cases can be clubed and few need to be removed . I have provided comments in the appropriate scenarios
